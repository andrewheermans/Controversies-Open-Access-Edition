Controversies was originally written for use in “RHE 306: Introduction to Rhetoric & Writing” courses at the University of Texas at Austin. Grounded in practical application for modern public discourse, the book offers foundational lessons in research, analysis, and argumentation to help students develop college-level writing and critical thinking skills. The text also includes recommendations for instructors for classroom exercises, discussions, assignment prompts, and extended explanation of key rhetorical concepts.

The **“Introduction”** provides explanation of core concepts students and instructors will use throughout the semester in order to choose, understand, analyze, and develop arguments for their controversy.

**Chapters #1-3** teach students how to conduct research including distinguishing between types of sources, identifying credibility and bias in 21st century texts, fairly representing author intentions and arguments, and determining source usefulness. At the end of this unit, students are expected to produce writing that provides an overview of their chosen controversy, synthesizing its history, its current complexities, and its range of viewpoints.

**Chapters #4-7** explain how to analyze speakers’ arguments and persuasive strategies by: understanding texts’ rhetorical situation; identifying appeals to audiences’ trust, emotions, and beliefs; and examining argumentative claims and evidence. Throughout these chapters, students will prepare to write a rhetorical analysis of a specific argumentative text that participates in their controversy’s discourse.

**Chapters #8-10** introduce students to the many different kinds of arguments they can make to support an overall proposition, offer methods for responding to others’ arguments, and provide structural frameworks for arranging the many pieces of an argument. This unit and course-based textbook culminate in student production of a persuasive argumentative essay written for a specific audience to convince them to feel a certain way or do a certain thing about an aspect of the controversy they have examined all semester.
